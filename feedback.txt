2024-11-06 12:21:51.947692: This is the second batch of feedback
2024-11-06 12:28:20.243189: This is the third iteration of feedback
2024-11-16 22:01:40.369348: Add defaults for the settings, add functionality to the "Progress" screen. But most importantly, have something in the "Start Session" screen that changes the colour!
2024-11-22 12:25:54.003591: It works, but i am not sure what it does lol
2024-11-23 22:34:01.545097: Exciting stuff, Andreas. It is great to see how your project has progressed and the EEG machine in operation (live)!

Great to see the colour of the pop up box change as my alpha/beta etc readings changed. Just watching that made me try to concentrate more!

Suggested future improvements:
1. maybe a 'n.a.' option for colour blindness may be a useful addition and 
2. I suggest the csv file name that stores the readings be a bit shorter/more user friendly?  (I understand it tracks the date and time but a simpler version may be more user friendly?).

Perhaps a more graphical real time interface showing brain activity might be useful.
